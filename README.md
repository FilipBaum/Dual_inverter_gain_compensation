# Dual_inverter_gain_compensation

This repository contains dataset for the 3D nonlinear gain compensation characteristic that is a part of the paper "Hybrid Overmodulation Strategy for Dual Two Level Inverters with Arbitrary DC Bus Voltage Distribution" submitted to IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification. The data is in the .csv format. The first column corresponds to the DC-bus voltage ratio r_DC, second column corresponds to the reference modulation index m_ref and the third column represents the gain values G.
